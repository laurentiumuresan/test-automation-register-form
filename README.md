## Description

This project aims to automate the testing of the Signup page on the target website. It utilizes the Selenium WebDriver framework for browser automation, TestNG as the testing framework, and Maven as the build tool and dependency management system.

The tests are designed to cover various scenarios related to user signup, including input validation, error messages, and form submission. By automating these tests, we can ensure that the Signup page functions correctly and validate its behavior under different conditions.
